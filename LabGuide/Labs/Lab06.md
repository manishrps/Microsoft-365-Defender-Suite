## Lab 06 - Launch Phishing Simulation Campaigns. 

## Lab scenario

In this lab, we will engage in a simulated phishing attack using the Microsoft Defender portal. The objective is to launch a targeted phishing campaign, specifically focusing on credential harvesting techniques. We will navigate through the portal to configure the simulation, including selecting the payload, defining target users, assigning training, and setting up end-user notifications. The exercise culminates in the analysis of user activity and the effectiveness of the phishing simulation through the detailed reports generated by Microsoft Defender.

## Lab objectives (Duration: minutes)


In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:
- Exercise 1: Simulate a Phishing Attack.

1. Click on the **Credentials_simulation** and navigate to the **Report** section.

      ![Picture 1](../Media/image_39.png)

1. Users will receive an email notification after some time. The Defender captures and records the user details when the user clicks on the URL, and respective training will be assigned to them.
