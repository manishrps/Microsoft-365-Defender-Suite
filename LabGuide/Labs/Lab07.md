## Lab 07 - Create Incidents 

## Lab scenario


Creating Incidents in Microsoft 365 Defender involves identifying potential security threats from various alerts and promptly responding to mitigate risks. Security analysts investigate these alerts to confirm their severity and impact.

## Lab objectives (Duration: minutes)


In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:
- Exercise 1: Simulated Attacks create Incident

### Exercise 1: Simulated Attacks to create Incident

In this task, you will run two simulated attacks to explore the capabilities of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

1. If you are not already at the Microsoft 365 Defender portal in your Microsoft Edge browser, go to (https://security.microsoft.com). 

1. In the **Sign in** dialog box, copy and paste * Email/Username: <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject> and then select Next.

1. In the **Enter password** dialog box, copy and paste * Password: <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject> and then select **Sign in**.

1. From the menu, under **Endpoints**, select **Evaluation & tutorials** and then select **Tutorials & simulations** from the left side.

1. Select the **Tutorials** tab.

1. Under *Automated investigation (backdoor)* you will see a message describing the scenario. Below this paragraph, click **Read the walkthrough**. A new browser tab opens which includes instructions to perform the simulation.

1. In the new browser tab, locate the section named **Run the simulation** (page 5, starting at step 2) and follow the steps to run the attack. **Hint:** The simulation file *RS4_WinATP-Intro-Invoice.docm* can be found back in portal, just below the **Read the walkthrough** you selected in the previous step by selecting the **Get simulation file** button. 

1. After downloading the file,  open the file with **Microsoft Word** and enter the password as `WDATP!diy#`.

1. In the Sign in dialog box, click on **Sign in** copy and paste in the Username and password provided in the environment details page, and select next.    

1. Click **Enable Editing** if the document opens inProtectedView. If you see a subsequent security warning about macros being disabled.    

1. To unblock the document, navigate to its location in File Explorer. In File Explorer, right-click the document, and select Properties. In the General tab, mark the Unblock option under Security.   

1. Close the **Microsoft Word** and re-open from the File Explorer and enter the password as `WDATP!diy#` after re-opening click on **Enable Content** and click on **OK**. 

1. In the Command prompt pop-up press any key to close. 
      
>**Note:** **Congrats – you’re done running the attack!** The attack simulation ends here. A real attacker, if successful, would likely continue to scan for information, send collected reconnaissance information to a command-and-control (C&C) server, and use this information to move laterally and pursue other attractive targets. Next, let’s review and investigate the Defender for Endpoint alerts that surfaced in the simulated attack.

>**Note:** Alerts should start to appear 15-30 minutes after the simulated backdoor is launched.

14. In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal select **Incidents & alerts** from the left menu bar, then select **Incidents**.

15. A new incident called "Multi-stage incident..." is in the right pane. Click the incident name to load its details.
