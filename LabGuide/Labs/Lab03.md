### Exercise 1: Configure Anti-Spam Policy

Anti-spam policies serve as the backbone for managing configurable settings related to spam filtering. These policies play a crucial role in filtering both incoming and outgoing emails, employing a diverse range of techniques such as content analysis and sender reputation checks to identify and prevent the transmission of spam. Anti-Spam policies are essential components in safeguarding your email communication against unwanted and potentially harmful spam. By configuring these policies, you gain control over the parameters that dictate how spam is identified and handled within your email environment.

### Exercise 2: Configure Anti-malware Policy

Anti-Malware policies are designed to safeguard against malware, viruses, spyware, and other harmful software that could be transmitted through emails. Anti-Malware policies scan incoming and outgoing emails for malicious content like malware and viruses. They use signature-based and behavior-based detection to identify threats, taking predefined actions upon detection, such as quarantining or deleting malicious attachments or links.

1. Go to Microsoft Defender Portal at https://security.microsoft.com/.
2. Go to **Email and Collaboration** > **Policies & rules**> Select the **Threat policies**.
